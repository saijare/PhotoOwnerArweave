Photo Owner Arweave
This software stores your photos forever on the Arweave blockchain. In addition the software associates each photo with the owner name, file name and SAH256 hash code. SAH256 is the strongest hash function which produces hash code for the photo as its fingerprints. This software can help storing NFT files.
To store your photo do these steps:
1- Connect to Arweave with your Arweave wallet file. 
2- Open the photo you want to save to Arweave. 
3- Calculate the SAH256 hash code for the photo. 
4- Write your name or the name of the photo's owner. 
5- Send the photo to Arweave and you can see and you can copy the transaction ID. In addition to the photo, also the owner name, file name and SAH256 hashqa code will be sent to in the Arweave blockchain. 
6- Use the transaction ID to retrieve the data. You will see the retrieved data: the photo, the owner name, the file name and the SAH256 hash code. Also the photo will be downloaded.
